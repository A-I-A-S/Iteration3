            <h2>1. Collection of Personal Information</h2>
            <p>We collect the following personal information when you use our web application for video object 
                identification:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>(i) Video Data for Item Scanning:
                        When you upload videos, we process them for object 
                        identification using machine learning algorithms. This includes capturing spatial and temporal 
                        attributes of objects within the video frames. For item scanning, we identify and analyze 
                        objects within the video to provide relevant information.</li>

                        We also collect image and video data for counting 
                        purposes. This involves analyzing the content to determine the quantity of specific objects or 
                        events (e.g., counting people, vehicles, or other items).</li>
