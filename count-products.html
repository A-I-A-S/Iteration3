                <h1>Count Products</h1>
                <p>Once the products have been scanned and their details stored in the AIAS storage, the "Count Products" feature comes into play. This functionality allows users to quickly and accurately count the stock of each product by simply scanning them again. The system matches the scanned product with its database entry, providing instant recognition and updating the inventory count. This feature is invaluable during routine stocktakes, reducing the need for manual counting and ensuring that inventory data is always accurate and up-to-date.</p>
